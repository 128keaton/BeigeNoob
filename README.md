BeigeNoob
========
What was going to be a security plugin for Beige Box, now BitCraft, now SpreadButton, quickly didn't happen. It is really outdated, use only if you want it on an old bukkit server (Tekkit Classic, nostalgia servers, etc) and I cannot guarantee it working. Whatever...

Compiled in Eclipse, woo, open source.
